# Mushroom-Prediction

**This project was completed on August 22th 2023**. <br>
The notebook is too big to render in Github, but can be seen using this link: https://nbviewer.org/github/juratev/Mushroom-Prediction/blob/main/415.ipynb

### Dataset
The data is sourced from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/maysee/mushrooms-classification-common-genuss-images). 
Within this dataset, there are nine folders, each dedicated to a different type of mushroom. Each folder holds between 300 to 1,500 images.

### Project aim
Developing a machine learning model capable of discerning different types of mushrooms. 

### Technologies
The project uses the following libraries: **NumPy**, **pandas**, **fastai**.
